        - made it clear that if successfully ran after it prints out an
          error that it had a problem with one of the methods, such as:
                "...Got a timeout after X seconds ..."
                "...method tried was: <whatever>
          by printing a closing message of:
                "...had success with method: <whatever>
          If it completely fails to get the IP number after trying all 
          methods, it will still end with the message:
                "...unable to get our IP number from Internet"
          so it will now be clear if it worked or failed.
