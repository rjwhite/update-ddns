    Makefile:
        - updated to not clobber config file if it already

1.0     Aug 17, 2022:
    switching now from RCS to git for inclusion into Github
    keep RCS history just in case.  Have git ignore RCS

1.1     Aug 29, 2022:
    update-ddns.plx:
        - get_our_ip_number() has inconsistent returns between
          errors and non-errors.  Also reworked for better error
          handling.
    README.md:
         -typo fixed

1.1.1   Aug 30, 2022:
    README.md:
        - fixed description of Moxad::Rcommand usage.  
          said STDIN instead of STDOUT

1.1.2   Aug 31, 2022:
    README.md:
        - had to escape <string> to \<string\>

1.1.3   Sep 8, 2022:
    README.first:
        - overhauled.  mostly to cover requirements

        - ARRRRGGG !!! updated misleading comments AGAIN...

1.2     Dec 14, 2022:
    update-ddns.plx:
        - made it clear that if successfully ran after it prints out an
          error that it had a problem with one of the methods, such as:
                "...Got a timeout after X seconds ..."
                "...method tried was: <whatever>
          by printing a closing message of:
                "...had success with method: <whatever>
          If it completely fails to get the IP number after trying all 
          methods, it will still end with the message:
                "...unable to get our IP number from Internet"
          so it will now be clear if it worked or failed.

1.2.1   Jan 11, 2023
    update-ddns.plx:
    man/man1/update-ddns.1:
        - added a -S|--show-ip option to just print our current IP number
          and then exit
    README.md:
        - updated usage example

1.3     Jan 28, 2023
    update-ddns.plx:
        - added options -D/--disable and -E/--enable to create/remove a
          lock file that will prevent update-ddns from updating a changed
          IP number
        - if the 'vpn-test' method exists in the new 'disable' section of
          the config file, then if tghat program returns 'vpn', then it
          will prevent update-ddns updating a changed IP address since it
          will be a temporary VPN address that should be ignored
        - changed the timestamp in the saved IP file from GMT to local time
        - replaced routine save_old_ip() with a generic create_file() routine
          used for both saving the old IP number and creating a lock file for
          the new --enable and --disable options.
        - if there is a 'log-file' in the 'files' section of the config file,
          then a log entry will be made of any IP changes
        - updated perldoc info
        - have options print out in alphabtical order with --help option
    test-for-vpn.sh:
        - created to test for VPN - used by config. See 'vpn-test' in config
    SAMPLE-update-ddns.conf:
        - renamed from update-ddns.conf.  Done so it doesn't cause
          confusion running update-ddns from the source directory
          and using the sample config file instead of the real one.
        - added section 'disable' with methods 'lock-file' and 'vpn-test'
        - added log-file in 'files' section
    Makefile:
        - removed installation of the config file.  Must now be installed
          manually to ensure a proper config file is created using
          SAMPLE-update-ddns.conf.  See README.first for instructions.
        - added install of test-for-vpn.sh
    man/man1/update-ddns.1:
        - document new behaviour of disabling the update of IP number and
          logging and explain disabling of IP update using the new methods
    README.first:
        - replaced section about config file installation.
    README.md:
        - updated usage and config file examples

1.3.1   Jan 28, 2023

          new --disable/--enable options (1.3)

    README.md:
        - improved examples and made clearer
